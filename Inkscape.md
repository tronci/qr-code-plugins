# Introduction #
A simple plug-in for Inkscape to render a vector QR Code on the workspace.

# Install #
Copy .inx and .py files to your Inkscape share\extensions directory.

Example: if Inkscape is installed in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inkscape\"
copy files to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inkscape\share\extensions\"

# Usage #
Once the plug-in is installed open Inkscape and in the menu select
**Extensions > Render > Barcode - QR Code...** to open dialog.

Enter some content and click **Apply** to render QR Code on the workspace.

# Notes #
  * Uses web service to generate a QR Code so the plug-in requires internet connection.
  * Make QR Code blocks black or very dark and keep the background white or light so the code becomes readable.
