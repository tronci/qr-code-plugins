# Introduction #

JSX script for Photoshop generates a QR Code with layers and selection. Script runs slowly but does the job.

# Install #
No installation is required. Script can run from any directory.

Optionally copy the .jsx file to your Photoshop scripts directory.

Example: copy files to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Presets\Scripts\"

# Usage #
Open Photoshop and in menu select **File > Scripts > Browse...** and find .jsx file.

Enter some content and click **Create** to render QR Code on the workspace.

# Notes #
  * Uses web service to generate a QR Code so the plug-in requires internet connection.
  * Make QR Code blocks black or very dark and keep the background white or light so the code is readable.
  * Be patient as the script renders slowly.
