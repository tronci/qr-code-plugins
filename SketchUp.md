# Introduction #

A simple plug-in for SkechUp to generate QR Code blocks.

# Install #
Copy .html and .rb files to your SketchUp plugins directory.

Example: if SketchUp is installed in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Google SketchUp 8\"
copy files to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Google SketchUp 8\Plugins\"

# Usage #
Once the plug-in is installed open SketchUp and in the menu select
**Draw > QR Code** to open dialog.

Enter some content and click **Generate** button to render a QR Code on the workspace.

# Notes #
  * Tested with Google SketchUp 8
  * Uses web service to generate a QR Code so the plug-in requires   internet connection.
  * Close the Outliner before generating QR Code. This technique will generate QR Code faster since the Outliner does not flicker.
  * Make QR Code blocks black or very dark and keep the background white or light so the code becomes readable.
  * It may take some time to render QR Code so please be patient.
